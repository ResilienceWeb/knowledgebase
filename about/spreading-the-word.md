# 🌍 Spreading the word

### Share with like-minded organisations

Do you know people from organisations who might want to set up their own local instance of Resilience Web in a new location? Put us in touch!

> Hi \[name], I came across this place-based mapping tool called Resilience Web. They've built a platform that allows anyone to create a place-based visual directory of environmental and social justice groups, which allows community contributions among other useful features.
>
> If that sounds interesting to you, have a look at their website at [resilienceweb.org.uk](https://resilienceweb.org.uk) where you can start creating a web or get in touch with them.

### Add a link to your website

If you add a link to our website, you can help us show up higher in search engine results. This would allow others to find us more easily.

Either share a link to our homepage, or if your listing or web is on the platform feel free to use one of the following images on your website:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/proud-member (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/proud-member-square.png" alt="" width="248"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can also use the following code snippet, which has the link already included:

```html
<a href="https://resilienceweb.org.uk" target="_blank">
  <img width="400" height="140" src="https://resilienceweb.org.uk/proud-member.png" alt="Proud to be part of Resilience Web" />
</a>
```
