# 🙋 How to get involved

There are lots of ways you can help out, and we'd love for you to join in however you like! If you enjoy coding, we always welcome volunteers developers. If not, there are plenty of other ways you can contribute and be a valuable part of our project.

Here are some ways you can help out:

* Create a new web (see the guide in the side bar) for your location.
* Attend our [online monthly assembly](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/resilience-web-monthly-assembly-tickets-1220916868219) where you can ask questions and get to know us.&#x20;
* Submit bug reports or feature requests on our [Github repository](https://github.com/ResilienceWeb/resilience-web/issues).
* Donate to our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/resilience-web). We especially welcome recurring contributions.
* Share and talk about Resilience Web to communities who may benefit from using it.
* Create use case using the 'tags' feature on any Resilience Web, for example, '[A penny saved](https://resilienceweb.org.uk/news/a-penny-saved)' on the Cambridge Resilience Web.

If there's another way you'd like to contribute, please get in touch at info@resilienceweb.org.uk
