# Linking to other webs

If there are any webs that are related in some way or in close proximity to your web, you can add a link to the from the Web Settings page in the Admin dashboard. You can only do this if you are the owner of the web.

You can edit the linked webs using this control:<br>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The linked webs will look like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
