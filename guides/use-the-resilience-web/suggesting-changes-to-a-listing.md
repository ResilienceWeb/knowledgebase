# Suggesting changes to a listing

Starting December 2024, people can now suggest changes (like adding missing info or corrections) to any listing on the Resilience Web. Anyone can do that, whether or not they are admins of that particular web. These changes will require approval from an admin with editor permissions in order to be applied.

On any individual listing page, press the Blue button on the bottom right.

This will take you to a page where you can make your changes.

Once you submit the form, your suggestions will go to the team of web maintainers to review. If your changes were approved, you will receive an email confirmation letting you know.
