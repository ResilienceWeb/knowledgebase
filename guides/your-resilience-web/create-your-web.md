# Create your web

### Name your web

Decide on a name for your web, generally the name of the town or city you’re in, and follow the [create-a-web.md](../technical-howtos/create-a-web.md "mention") to create a web.&#x20;

### Banner image

You will also want to add a banner image that will appear for your web on the front page.  Start thinking about what will represent your web well — maybe the skyline of your town, or a local nature spot. Please use a photo that you have taken or own the rights to.&#x20;

### Categories

You probably have some idea of the broad categories of listings that you will have on your web. Your web will come by default with the following categories, which you are free to modify, delete and add to however you want. Create categories that are useful and meaningful to your community.&#x20;

* Community
* Education
* Environment
* Food
* Health
* Human rights
* Social justice

The categories can be modified, renamed, deleted and added as you go, and you might find that some merge or split as you begin adding listings to your web.&#x20;

### Neighbouring Webs

You can link to neighbouring webs directly from your web.  Are there any you want to include?&#x20;

### Play around and experiment

When you first create your web it is available only to people who know the link so that you can populate it and make it an interesting space before going live. It will only be listed on the main page after you explicitly publish it, so feel free to experiment and change things!&#x20;
