# Advertise your web

### Your web is done! Congratulations!

Now it’s time to tell the world about it.&#x20;

We have several suggestions for ways to communicate your web out to the wider world. You can do some or all of these, as is appropriate for your community. If you have other ideas for advertising that work well for you, please let us know and we’ll add them to this list.&#x20;

### Neighbouring Webs

Get in touch with the owners of neighbouring webs (if there are any) and ask them to include your web as a neighbouring web on their web.&#x20;

### In person events

* Host a launch event (we have some funding to support webs in Cambridgeshire).
* Attend local conferences or events and promote the Resilience Web either by handing out flyers or giving a talk.
* Attend local fairs and share a booth with other community groups or hand out flyers to attendees.
* Talk to the local council&#x20;

### Physical advertising

* Ads in local papers
* Physical posters
* Flyers
* Stickers

### Online advertising

* When your web is ready to launch, we will advertise it to our mailing list and social media.&#x20;
* API — Encourage groups to link back to the Resilience Web.  More information is available in our guide: [https://knowledgebase.resilienceweb.org.uk/guides/use-the-resilience-web/embedding-resilience-web-on-other-websites](https://knowledgebase.resilienceweb.org.uk/guides/use-the-resilience-web/embedding-resilience-web-on-other-websites)
* Social media — we have a set of templates that you are welcome to use.
