# Your Community

### Your Community

Who is your community?  It could be your town or city.  Most of the webs are centered around towns, you could also be connected in a different way, for example, the web could be focused on a river’s catchment area.&#x20;

Your community might be united by something other than geography.  We don’t have any examples at present, but don’t want to exclude the idea of creating a web of festivals, for example.&#x20;

The purpose of creating a web is to serve your community, and you might want to try something we haven’t though of yet. Great!&#x20;

Feel free to attend our Monthly Assembly to discuss your use case, and to ask any questions you have.

### Collaboration

Building a web is a community effort and we recommend that you work together with at least one other person on your Resilience Web. We all have different strengths, and working with a team of founding members can help ensure that someone is happy to focus on the technical details, and someone else is happy to meet many of the community groups and to be the face of your web.&#x20;

Working with someone also means redundancy is built into your web from the beginning, and redundancy is one aspect of resilience.&#x20;

### Finding collaborators

If you don’t have collaborators in mind, here are some approaches to find people who might be interested:

* Attend the meetings of local groups and ask for 5 minutes to present the Resilience Web and make the case for one local to your area.  At the end of your presentation, ask if anyone would like to join you in creating the web.
* Host a working meeting to create the web.  Schedule a time, perhaps in a local community center, when you will create the web and begin to add entries to it. Advertise your event, and see who turns up.
* Build it and they will come. Sometimes it can be difficult to find folks who are interested, and it can be easier to capture the imagination of people if you already have something concrete to show them.  Go ahead and create your web, show it to people and encourage them to contribute entries that fill in the gaps you have missed.&#x20;

### Guiding Principles

There are three principles that guide the creation of a team of founding members:

* There is no hierarchy; the Resilience Web is co-produced through consensus by your founding members in service of your community.
* Everyone has a voice and is heard.
* The focus of the web is on collaboration and on bringing people together.
