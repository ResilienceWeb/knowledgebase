# Launch your web

### Ready to launch?

You will be ready to launch when your web is an interesting and useful place.  Generally, this means you have about 10 listings, but in very small towns you might not be able to find more than this. If you’ve tried several of the methods suggested for finding new groups and keep coming up with the same old ones over again, then you’re ready to launch. In large cities, there’s no need to have a comprehensive list of all the groups before you launch. You can always continue to add groups after you launch.&#x20;
