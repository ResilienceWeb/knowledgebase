# 🌍 Your Resilience Web

We’re glad you’re interested in creating a web for your community! This guide will walk you through the process of creating a web. Your web will be an online space that will create a map of community groups. The exact focus of the web is up to you — resilience has many different meanings to different people, whether adapting to the climate crisis, strengthening community bonds, or ensuring everyone can thrive. What does your community need?&#x20;

The Resilience Web is an online directory that helps you raise the visibility of community groups, helping new volunteers find them, and also helping groups find each other to potentially collaborate on larger projects.&#x20;

The Cambridge Web is focused on mapping the many groups in Cambridge whose goals are broadly related to sustainability and social justice.

The rest of this guide will give you many ideas for how to think about creating the web as a collaboration with your community, and the possibilities to strengthen community connections that having the web will create.&#x20;
