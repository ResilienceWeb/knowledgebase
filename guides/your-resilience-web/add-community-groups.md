# Add community groups

### Boundaries

What listings should be included on your web?

If your web is for a town, you might want to choose a clear geographic boundary and only include organisations operating within the boundary. Anything that’s outside might be better included on a neighbouring web.

Secondly, consider the conceptual boundaries of your web.  The Resilience Web is generally for environment and social justice community groups, but you can define exactly what this means for your community.  Sport and fitness clubs, art groups, child play groups all build connection and community resilience in different ways.&#x20;

Some examples include:

* The Cambridge web has chosen not to include religious groups unless they specifically have a subgroup that is working directly in one of these areas, for example. &#x20;
* The South West London web has a focus on disaster response.&#x20;
* The water web (still under development) for groups that are working on water issues in the River Cam catchment area has a much broader geographic area, but a much narrower conceptual boundary. We encourage creative ways of thinking about the webs.&#x20;

### Find community groups

You probably know about a lot of groups working on the intersectional goals of environmental and social justice in your area already. These are great starting points for adding to your Resilence Web. &#x20;

To scope out other organisations that you may not know about, we have a few strategies:

* Begin with your team and brainstorm all the community groups that serve your community in various ways.&#x20;
* Talk to people in your area, tell them you are making a Resilience Web, and find out what groups they think should be included.&#x20;
* Check out what’s happening at your local pub or community center, who is running evenings or events?&#x20;
* Try doing a web search for the name of your town and each of the categories you identiifed in the previous step. This might help you find groups you didn’t know about.&#x20;
* Research the groups you know about.  Look on their website, have they run events in collaboration with anyone else? Should their collaborators be included on your web too?
* Attend events put on by the groups in your area.  Who else is attending, and do they represent other groups that should be included?

To add a listing, follow the (howto guide)\[../Technical Howtos/Add listings]

You do not need to contact groups in advance to add them to your web.&#x20;
